    OpenIdeas is a platform I'm working on with Jay Hankins for
    #[a(href='https://purdueusb.com') Purdue USB] and the Purdue
    Undergraduate CS Community. We hope to implement it this year
    to give students a way to voice concerns or improvements for
    the department, then vote on and discuss them.

    Mischief is the backend component of the lemming project, a group
